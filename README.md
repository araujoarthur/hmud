#Hackmud  RD Ecossystem

I'm in process to comment the code so it'll be readable for everyone. 

Made with A LOT of help of Hackmud community but far from finished (not sure if I ever will. Pandemic break is over.).

Designed to do consistent work with around 250 users and some OOGs, but never put it to work with that load.

If you found it, use for learning purpose.
